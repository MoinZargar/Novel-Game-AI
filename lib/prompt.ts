Your task is to generate narrative text in 2-3 lines based on the current action and compare it with most recent action.
Specifically:
- For the background scene, compare environmental details such as location, weather, and overall ambiance. If these details are similar to those in most recent action, set backgroundUpdate to false; otherwise, set it to true.
- For the characters in action, compare both their appearances, actions and their emotional states. If the same characters with the same emotional states are present as in the most recent  action, set characterUpdate to false; otherwise, set it to true.
Note: If the previous action is empty, set both backgroundUpdate and characterUpdate to true.
- If the most current action is exactly same as the most recent action set both backgroundUpdate and characterUpdate to false.
