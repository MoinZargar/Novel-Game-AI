Your task is to generate short narrative text in just 2 lines based on the current action and compare it with previous actions.
Specifically:
- For the background scene, compare environmental details such as location, weather, and overall ambiance. If these details are similar to those in the previous action, set backgroundUpdate to false; otherwise, set it to true.
- For the characters, compare both their appearances and their emotional states. If the same characters with the same emotional states are present as in the previous action, set characterUpdate to false; otherwise, set it to true.
Note: If the previous action is empty, set both backgroundUpdate and characterUpdate to true.
